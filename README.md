# NaturalKnapsack
In this project, we attempt to solve a modified version of the Multi-Objective Quadratic Multiple Knapsack Problem using an Mu plus Lambda Evolutionary Algorithm strategy. The goal was to optimize 3 objectives: 
1. Maximize the total profit of all the knapsacks
2. Minimize the total weight of the items in the knapsacks
3. Maximize the minimum profit of all the knapsacks

More information on the approach as well as a more formal problem definition can be found in our report ([Evolutionary_QKP_Solver_Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/upadhyan/NaturalKnapsack/blob/main/Evolutionary_QKP_Solver_Analysis.pdf)). The Python notebook [QKP Evolutionary Algorithm.pynb](https://github.com/upadhyan/NaturalKnapsack/blob/main/QKP%20Evolutionary%20Algorithm.ipynb) contains all the code necessary to run and test the evolutionary algorithm developed.
The R Notebook  [ga_statistics.Rmd](https://github.com/upadhyan/NaturalKnapsack/blob/main/ga_statistics.Rmd) contains the scripts used for the statistical analysis of our algorithm performance as well as the scripts used to generate the plots in our report.
